          <p>Few have actually come face to faces with this entity, and fewer still lived to tell the tale. Legends say millenia ago, another being appeared who had the strength  to rival Fish Lord. A fierce battle took place, at the end of which there stood no clear victor. It retreated to the depths, where it is said to remain to this day.</p>

          <p>Amphibious Ltd may not be a leading organisation, but it's one that Salamanager has built up from nothing, and as such, he's extremely proud of it. It's for this reason and many others that he has refused countless buyout proposals from Bear CEO (not least because she insists on paying him in salmon).</p>

          <p>This is one bug you don't want to try to step on. At an intimidating average of 8 feet long, large gatherings of this flame-reathed floor crawler devastated towns and villages millenia ago. Today, only fraction of their prior population remains, deep in the southern ash forests.</p>
